  <p>Over the past few days I&rsquo;ve taken to reading comic books, specifically <em>Hellblazer</em> and <em>Hellboy</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/FlamingHead.jpg" alt="The flaming head!">
Since most comic books are published on a per issue basis, I was worried that <a href="/books">my digital book collection</a> would quickly become unreadable with the amount of issues that would pile up.
For reference, my current system works like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Book Title (Series name + place in series)</em> - <em>Author Name</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, for comic books it&rsquo;ll look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Series Title #Issue no.</em> - <em>Author Name</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That should tidy things up a bit.
I mainly made this update so that I could add something to my blog for once, I&rsquo;ve been feeling lately that I&rsquo;m sleeping on its potential.
I&rsquo;ll try to upload a small blog post once a week going forward - like a book or movie review, or just a discussion about something on the web.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now, happy new year!</p>
<h2 id="addendum---180124">ADDENDUM - 18/01/24</h2>
<p>This post has become pretty redundant since I switched to reading omnibuses for my comic fix (better on the bank account).
I&rsquo;ll still keep this small post up for the time being, just in case I do read any individual issues in the future.</p>
