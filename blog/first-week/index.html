  <p>So my first week of college just wrapped up so I thought I&rsquo;d share my thoughts about how it went down.</p>
<h3 id="monday">Monday</h3>
<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t have my first Psychology class until the 18th I got to college just before my first Sociology, around 1230.
You can check out my notes <a href="https://github.com/BenWhiteXXII/College/tree/main">here</a> so I won&rsquo;t go too in depth in what we covered but it felt good to finally discuss some interesting ideas with more people, however basic they may be.</p>
<h3 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h3>
<p>Had my first Study Skills class where we were taught what a paragraph was.
I won&rsquo;t say any more than that.</p>
<h3 id="wednesday-and-thursday">Wednesday and Thursday</h3>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t have too much to do on these days, just work and writing up notes.</p>
<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>
<p>First Eng. Lit. class and probably my most dreaded first lesson went really well!
I won a pub quiz and got to briefly talk about one of my <a href="./books">favourite books</a>, On Earth We&rsquo;re Briefly Gorgeous.</p>
<p>Something kinda dramatic happened while I was writing this post; all my source files for my blog posts got deleted.
I use Hugo for my formatting, mainly so I can focus on what I write instead of how (I might make a future post about this), but it messed up and cleared the directory when I went to make this new post.
I&rsquo;ve recovered a few posts but I really can&rsquo;t be bothered to reconstruct some of my older posts.
Luckily hugo only ammends my website directory and doesn&rsquo;t delete any html files so they&rsquo;ll still be up unless I change my mind.</p>
