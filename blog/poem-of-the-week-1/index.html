<h2 id="ah-vastness-of-pines">Ah Vastness of Pines</h2>
<p>Ah vastness of pines, murmur of waves breaking,</p>
<p>slow play of lights, solitary bell,</p>
<p>twilight falling in your eyes, toy doll,</p>
<p>earth-shell, in whom the earth sings!</p>
<p>In you the rivers sing and my soul flees in them</p>
<p>as you desire, and you send it where you will.</p>
<p>Aim my road on your bow of hope</p>
<p>and in a frenzy I will flee my flock of arrows.</p>
<p>On all sides I see your waist of fog,</p>
<p>and your silence hunts down my afflicted hours;</p>
<p>my kisses anchor, and my moist desire nests</p>
<p>in your arms of transparent stone.</p>
<p>Ah your mysterious voice that love tolls and darkens</p>
<p>in the resonant and dying evening!</p>
<p>Thus in the deep hours I have seen, over the fields,</p>
<p>the ears of wheat tolling in the mouth of the wind.</p>
<p>This poem is one of my favourite&rsquo;s of Neruda and in my opinion makes for a perfect opening to this series.
While I wasn&rsquo;t attracted to all of his poems in the collection <em>Twenty love poems and a song of despair</em> I did love his descriptions of nature and the unique imagery they create, especially in this poem which he uses to create an isolating and almost apocolyptic atmosphere.</p>
