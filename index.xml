        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to start finishing some books, I&amp;rsquo;ve got way too many on the go at the moment and I haven&amp;rsquo;t bought a book in months&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mediocrity: a response</title>

&lt;figure &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/images/recognition.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Did you know that at one point this site was going to be called &amp;#39;The Recognition Scene&amp;#39;?&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://batts.substack.com/p/the-infinite-weight-of-mediocrity&#34;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; arrived in my inbox just a few moments ago and I just had to write down my thoughts.
You can read the full post yourself but I wanted to make a few points, mainly to help myself grab hold of some thoughts that have been squirming at the back of my head for a few months, perhaps even a few years, now.
I&amp;rsquo;ll open this by saying that I&amp;rsquo;m not an artist.
I don&amp;rsquo;t make art, I don&amp;rsquo;t even critise art, but I enjoy art and one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered time and time again is this: when it comes to art, you &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; fail.
Now I don&amp;rsquo;t mean this in a &amp;ldquo;if you don&amp;rsquo;t sell well you&amp;rsquo;re going to end up penniless and alone&amp;rdquo; sort-of-way, but moreso that &lt;em&gt;no matter what you make, you will have an audience&lt;/em&gt;.
For better and for worse I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, good art is not guaranteed to be successful.
Great art is not guaranteed to make you a dime.
But is that what matters here?
Being good at your craft is accomplishment itself, creative people can go for years without having the drive to create, because having ideas just isn&amp;rsquo;t enough.
To make something, something physical and tangible, is one of the most &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; drives that exists.
And it exists everywhere!
Cult films, outsider music, box office failures, home video, amature photography, craft fairs, and notes in the pages of second-hand books.
People cherish these works because it speaks to them specifically, and that&amp;rsquo;s probably why good art can never be universal.
I think there&amp;rsquo;s a bigger conversation to be had about what makes art good vs what makes it great (probably the commercial viability) but the bottom line is this:
Your art is not going anywhere becuase the people that enjoy it will never forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the core of this fact would be:
Making community is making it as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title is sort of a lie, this post changed into something else as I thought about it more and even now I think my stance is pretty naive.
But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a response as much as it is reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S
&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;This video from Greg Guevara&lt;/a&gt; was posted while I was drafting up this blog post.
It&amp;rsquo;s more about how to make your art more profitable but I thought it was good to include here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.P.S
This is my first blog post using the new scripts, and I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta say it does make getting my thoughts out a hell of a lot easier.
Look forward to a post about that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Poem of the Week - Prayer</title>
        <link>https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/posts/2024/poem-of-the-week-2/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        <author> </author>
        <guid>https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/posts/2024/poem-of-the-week-2/</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;prayer&#34;&gt;Prayer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask you this: &lt;br&gt;
Which way to go? &lt;br&gt;
I ask you this: &lt;br&gt;
Which sin to bear? &lt;br&gt;
Which crown to put &lt;br&gt;
Upon my hair? &lt;br&gt;
I do not know, &lt;br&gt;
Lord God, &lt;br&gt;
I do not know. &lt;br&gt;
&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Langston Hughes, Selected Poems (2020), publ. Serpent&amp;rsquo;s Tail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hughes&amp;rsquo; poems have an almost lyrical or song-like quality to them, influenced as he was by the Harlem jazz scene.
This is one of his simpler poems but still worth considering as you go about your week; each choice we make can have desirable and undesirable consequences.
The trick to choosing the best outcome is confidence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Poem of the Week - Ah Vastness of Pines</title>
        <link>https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/posts/2024/poem-of-the-week-1/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        <author> </author>
        <guid>https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/posts/2024/poem-of-the-week-1/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a new series of posts I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to stick to, if only to let me rediscover and rethink some of my favourite poetry.
Another bonus is that it&amp;rsquo;ll keep this blog updated and alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ah-vastness-of-pines&#34;&gt;Ah Vastness of Pines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah vastness of pines, murmur of waves breaking, &lt;br&gt;
slow play of lights, solitary bell, &lt;br&gt;
twilight falling in your eyes, toy doll, &lt;br&gt;
earth-shell, in whom the earth sings! &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In you the rivers sing and my soul flees in them &lt;br&gt;
as you desire, and you send it where you will. &lt;br&gt;
Aim my road on your bow of hope &lt;br&gt;
and in a frenzy I will flee my flock of arrows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On all sides I see your waist of fog, &lt;br&gt;
and your silence hunts down my afflicted hours; &lt;br&gt;
my kisses anchor, and my moist desire nests &lt;br&gt;
in your arms of transparent stone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah your mysterious voice that love tolls and darkens &lt;br&gt;
in the resonant and dying evening! &lt;br&gt;
Thus in the deep hours I have seen, over the fields, &lt;br&gt;
the ears of wheat tolling in the mouth of the wind. &lt;br&gt;
&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Pablo Neruda, Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair (2004), trans. W.S. Merwin, publ. Jonathan Cape&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poem is one of my favourite&amp;rsquo;s of Neruda and in my opinion makes for a perfect opening to this series.
While I wasn&amp;rsquo;t attracted to all of his poems in the collection &lt;em&gt;Twenty love poems and a song of despair&lt;/em&gt; I did love his descriptions of nature and the unique imagery they create, especially in this poem which he uses to create an isolating and almost apocolyptic atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A Short Guide to Plant Names</title>
        <link>https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/posts/2024/a-short-guide-to-plant-names/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        <author> </author>
        <guid>https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/posts/2024/a-short-guide-to-plant-names/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A short guide I wrote for myself on Latin plant names (mainly stolen and truncated from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/gardening-for-beginners-latin-plant-names/&#34;&gt;Gardener&amp;rsquo;s World&lt;/a&gt;.
Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/images/DirtyDream.png&#34; alt=&#34;Dirty Dream #2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;genus-and-species&#34;&gt;Genus and Species&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Latin (or botanical) name of a plant is binomial.
The genus comes first, stylised with a capital letter, with the species second.
For example, for the plant &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/rosa-rugosa/&#34;&gt;Rosa rugosa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rosa&lt;/em&gt; is the genus and &lt;em&gt;rugosa&lt;/em&gt; is the species.
All plants within the same species can reproduce with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;plant-families&#34;&gt;Plant Families&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every genus of plants belongs to a family which share certain characteristics.
It isn&amp;rsquo;t included in the binomial plant name but it is good to know in order to be more familiar with your plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sub-species&#34;&gt;Sub-species&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If plants are different from their common counterparts, usually due to location, they are distinguished via a sub-species tag after the plant name.
For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/anthemis-punctata-subsp-cupaniana/&#34;&gt;Anthemis punctata subsp. cupaniana&lt;/a&gt; is a sub-species of &lt;em&gt;Anthemis punctata&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;variety&#34;&gt;Variety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a naturally occuring variation of the main species it is differentiated by the variety tag.
Geranium sanguineum var. striatum is a variety of cranesbill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cultivar&#34;&gt;Cultivar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If plants come about through the cultivation two related plants (rather than from the wild) is called a cultivar.
While all other tags are written in Latin, the cultivar name is a modern language.
Since sometimes the parents&amp;rsquo; names are not known only the genus and cultivar names are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;forma&#34;&gt;Forma&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A forma tag is used to distinguish minor differences to the species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-from-gardeners-world&#34;&gt;Example from Gardener&amp;rsquo;s World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant names can tell you more about the plant.
Lavandula angustifolia &amp;lsquo;Nana Alba&amp;rsquo; has narrow leaves (angustifolia) and is compact (&amp;lsquo;Nana&amp;rsquo;) with white flowers (&amp;lsquo;Alba&amp;rsquo;).
Here are some common words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;colour&#34;&gt;Colour&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alba/albus - white&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;caerulea/caeruleus - blue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;coccinea/coccineus - scarlet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;argentea - silver&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;habitat&#34;&gt;Habitat&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alpina/alpinus - alpine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;campestris - field&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maritima - coastal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;montana - mountain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pratensis - meadow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sylvatica - forest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;characteristics&#34;&gt;Characteristics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;angustifolia - narrow leaves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fragans/fragrantissima - scented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;foetida/foetidus - smelly (unpleasant)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grandiflora - large-flowered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nana - small, compact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;odorata - perfumed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;officinalis - has herbal uses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tomentosum - hairy, downy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;habit&#34;&gt;Habit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;columnaris - columnar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dentata - toothed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;reptans - creeping&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scandens - climbing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;country-or-area-of-origin&#34;&gt;Country or area of origin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chinensis - China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;japonica - Japan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sibiricus - Siberia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;occidentalis - America&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Note on Comic Books in My Collection</title>
        <link>https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/posts/2024/a-note-on-comic-books-in-my-collection/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        <author> </author>
        <guid>https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/posts/2024/a-note-on-comic-books-in-my-collection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to reading comic books, specifically &lt;em&gt;Hellblazer&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/images/FlamingHead.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The flaming head!&#34;&gt;
Since most comic books are published on a per issue basis, I was worried that &lt;a href=&#34;https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/books&#34;&gt;my digital book collection&lt;/a&gt; would quickly become unreadable with the amount of issues that would pile up.
For reference, my current system works like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book Title (Series name + place in series)&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Author Name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for comic books it&amp;rsquo;ll look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Series Title #Issue no.&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Author Name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should tidy things up a bit.
I mainly made this update so that I could add something to my blog for once, I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling lately that I&amp;rsquo;m sleeping on its potential.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to upload a small blog post once a week going forward - like a book or movie review, or just a discussion about something on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for now, happy new year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;addendum---180124&#34;&gt;ADDENDUM - 18/01/24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post has become pretty redundant since I switched to reading omnibuses for my comic fix (better on the bank account).
I&amp;rsquo;ll still keep this small post up for the time being, just in case I do read any individual issues in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>End of Year Book Roundup</title>
        <link>https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/posts/2024/end-of-year-book-roundup/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        <author> </author>
        <guid>https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/posts/2024/end-of-year-book-roundup/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened to me this year and the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read certainly reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/images/ReadingCohen.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A girl reading Cohen&#34;&gt;
From self-help to Stephen King, from journalism to theatre, this eclectic mix represents me trying to find out what I love to read - and looking at the stats I&amp;rsquo;m not suprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the works I read were fiction, and the majority of those were fantasy.
I was suprised to see that only a few of the late Pratchett&amp;rsquo;s books adorned my list, partly because of how much I love his work and how much of his work I bought this year (there&amp;rsquo;s an excellent antique store not far from my house that is always stocked up with his vintage paperbacks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller pagecounts seem to be a trend, with the odd brick sneeking in (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you, &lt;em&gt;Babel&lt;/em&gt;). This&amp;rsquo;ll be a habit I hope to keep up as I hope to expand my horizons with sci-fi and shorter non-fiction texts in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audiobooks were definitely a boon for me at the start of the year, which is why I came out swinging with so many books read and although I don&amp;rsquo;t note which books I listened to (as opposed to read) I may do in the future just so that I can keep track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go down the list I can notice where my infactuation with older texts begins (around may) and is exaggerated by historical fiction and poetry.
In December especially I dove into theatre, reading eveverything I could by the great Athenian tragic playwright Sophecles.
This is something else I hope to keep up with in 2024 as I went a bit overboard in secondhand bookshops, buying up everything ancient Greek + Roman related I could afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into the new year I hope to finish the Monkey Wrench Gang and move onto Howard Fishman&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;To Anyone Who Ever Asked&lt;/em&gt;, a biography about a mysterious singer-songwriter from the 1950s.
After that I plan to re-read &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; ready for the new movie in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ps&#34;&gt;P.S.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should add, for posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake, that I read 39 books.
Not a bad number but I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for at least a book a week in 2024.
Knowing my track record of sticking to goals, let&amp;rsquo;s see how that turns out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>First Week</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;So my first week of college just wrapped up so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my thoughts about how it went down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday&#34;&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have my first Psychology class until the 18th I got to college just before my first Sociology, around 1230.
You can check out my notes &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/BenWhiteXXII/College/tree/main&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; so I won&amp;rsquo;t go too in depth in what we covered but it felt good to finally discuss some interesting ideas with more people, however basic they may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday&#34;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had my first Study Skills class where we were taught what a paragraph was.
I won&amp;rsquo;t say any more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-and-thursday&#34;&gt;Wednesday and Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t have too much to do on these days, just work and writing up notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday&#34;&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Eng. Lit. class and probably my most dreaded first lesson went really well!
I won a pub quiz and got to briefly talk about one of my &lt;a href=&#34;./books&#34;&gt;favourite books&lt;/a&gt;, On Earth We&amp;rsquo;re Briefly Gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something kinda dramatic happened while I was writing this post; all my source files for my blog posts got deleted.
I use Hugo for my formatting, mainly so I can focus on what I write instead of how (I might make a future post about this), but it messed up and cleared the directory when I went to make this new post.
I&amp;rsquo;ve recovered a few posts but I really can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to reconstruct some of my older posts.
Luckily hugo only ammends my website directory and doesn&amp;rsquo;t delete any html files so they&amp;rsquo;ll still be up unless I change my mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Plans Before College</title>
        <link>https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/posts/2023/plans-before-college/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I start college in little under a month so I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a good idea to go over what I&amp;rsquo;m doing to ease myself back into education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tricky part about learning is that you never really stop, so this makes it tricky when trying to deliberately learn new things.
Sure, with enough time anyone can learn anything, but if you misjudge the amount of precursoury knowledge required then you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be in for a rough time straight out the gate.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m developing this post to remind myself what steps I can take and what I should do before I start my course in Septemeber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First (and Final) step: Read!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s literally it. I&amp;rsquo;ll go into more detail later on but if you want the long and short of it, there you go.
Reading now is so important because when I&amp;rsquo;m in college I&amp;rsquo;ll have to be doing it as much as possible, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just to bump up my personal statement.
There&amp;rsquo;s always something new to read that&amp;rsquo;ll expand what I already knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, so what to read?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be real with you, my attention span is not great.
This can be pretty frustrating if I&amp;rsquo;m trying to read.
So if I want to read I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to be smart about it.
This means getting the best info to word count ratio as possible.&lt;br&gt;
But what book could possibly give me that?
&lt;em&gt;Enter:&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/images/LitTheory.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;No Soap, Radio!&#34;&gt;
Literary Theory: an anthology.
A book with a stellar cover but its image is weakened by its academic title. The second edition goes for pretty cheap online so it&amp;rsquo;s well worth picking up a copy just to sit on your shelf and show everyone how smart you are. Beside the title, it has some great stuff inside. Take the fact that it has great historic works (Delueuze and Guattari&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Anti-Oedipus&lt;/em&gt;, Hegel&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt;, Zizek&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Sublime Object of Ideology&lt;/em&gt;) all shortened down to the parts that matter. The book explains Marx&amp;rsquo;s theory of capital, Hegel&amp;rsquo;s dialectics, Freud&amp;rsquo;s theories of psychoanalysis and more in its one thousand page count. And, because it explains so much, the articles/ exerpts are relitively small, allowing for a few to be read in a day - without making your head spin thanks to its useful grouping of subjects so everything you&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far feeds into each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book enables the first step of my plan: read one article a day before college, while trying to upload blog posts about what I read. This means that I&amp;rsquo;ll get used to this style of academic writing well before the course starts and I&amp;rsquo;ll have some clever ideas to bring up in essays. But this book alone isn&amp;rsquo;t going to help me ace any modern lit exams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>First Steps With LMMS</title>
        <link>https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/posts/2023/first-steps-with-lmms/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently decided to start recording some of the songs I make with my acoustic guitar.
The problem is that with my current setup anything I record sounds like shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to get around this problem by using a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) aka LMMS.
It’s open source, like most software I use, and - more importantly - free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s got a lot more tools than just recording input.
It comes with samples that you can use right out the box and plenty of ways to manipulate them so that you can get the unique sound you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://plugins4free.com/plugin/633/&#34;&gt;MeowSynth!&lt;/a&gt;
Although LMMS doesn’t come with it straight out the box MeowSynth is a free to use VST (Virtual Studio Technology) that synthesises a real cat’s meow.
I used it in the &lt;a href=&#34;music/meow.mp3&#34;&gt;first track I ever made.&lt;/a&gt;
It’s very simple but I’m proud of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue to post any cool tracks I make, even if it means kissing goodbye my invitation to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://1mb.club&#34;&gt;1mb club.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
