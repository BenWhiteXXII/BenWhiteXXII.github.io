      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/images/dreamer.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dreamer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After mulling over my ideas for a new campaign setting with a friend I&amp;rsquo;ve come to some indefinite conclusions about how I want the game to play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the rules should either be B/X, a similar retroclone or a modified version of Into The Odd. Like ITO there&amp;rsquo;s a focus more on problem-solving and the use f items rather than magical hand-waving. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll scrub rules for magic entirely since most of my players would be expecting something like 5e. If magic does exist then it comes with a great cost and a high risk, only the most nefarious and wicked would seek shortcuts to fate&amp;rsquo;s design. The characters too shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too heroic, Elrics more than Conans, who rely on their forward planning to survive - it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be uncommon for a player to have more than one character at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/images/monarch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Treacherous king&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a longtime fan of pen and paper role-playing games - Into the Odd, Cairn, the titan Dungeons and Dragons, and a hundred others that are created by indie gamers and publishers every day. I haven&amp;rsquo;t played in a group for a few years now but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from coming up with ideas for games; sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s half the fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a few fragments of the new setting I&amp;rsquo;ve been working up over the past 2 weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s largely based off the declining reign of an monarch in a dying world, though there&amp;rsquo;s also a few hints at what comes later. All comes courtesy of my notes app and brief moments of solitude at work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
