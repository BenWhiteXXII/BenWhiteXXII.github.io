      <description>This post arrived in my inbox just a few moments ago and I just had to write down my thoughts. You can read the full post yourself but I wanted to make a few points, mainly to help myself grab hold of some thoughts that have been squirming at the back of my head for a few months, perhaps even a few years, now. I&amp;rsquo;ll open this by saying that I&amp;rsquo;m not an artist.</description>
