      <description>&lt;figure &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/images/recognition.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Did you know that at one point this site was going to be called &amp;#39;The Recognition Scene&amp;#39;?&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://batts.substack.com/p/the-infinite-weight-of-mediocrity&#34;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; arrived in my inbox just a few moments ago and I just had to write down my thoughts.&#xA;You can read the full post yourself but I wanted to make a few points, mainly to help myself grab hold of some thoughts that have been squirming at the back of my head for a few months, perhaps even a few years, now.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll open this by saying that I&amp;rsquo;m not an artist.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t make art, I don&amp;rsquo;t even critise art, but I enjoy art and one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered time and time again is this: when it comes to art, you &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; fail.&#xA;Now I don&amp;rsquo;t mean this in a &amp;ldquo;if you don&amp;rsquo;t sell well you&amp;rsquo;re going to end up penniless and alone&amp;rdquo; sort-of-way, but moreso that &lt;em&gt;no matter what you make, you will have an audience&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;For better and for worse I guess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
