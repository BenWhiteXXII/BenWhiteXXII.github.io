      <title>Notes on a world</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/images/monarch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Treacherous king&#34;&gt;&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m a longtime fan of pen and paper role-playing games - Into the Odd, Cairn, the titan Dungeons and Dragons, and a hundred others that are created by indie gamers and publishers every day. I haven&amp;rsquo;t played in a group for a few years now but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from coming up with ideas for games; sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s half the fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a few fragments of the new setting I&amp;rsquo;ve been working up over the past 2 weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s largely based off the declining reign of an monarch in a dying world, though there&amp;rsquo;s also a few hints at what comes later. All comes courtesy of my notes app and brief moments of solitude at work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;figure &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://BenWhiteXXII.github.io/images/recognition.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Did you know that at one point this site was going to be called &amp;#39;The Recognition Scene&amp;#39;?&#34;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://batts.substack.com/p/the-infinite-weight-of-mediocrity&#34;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; arrived in my inbox just a few moments ago and I just had to write down my thoughts.&#xA;You can read the full post yourself but I wanted to make a few points, mainly to help myself grab hold of some thoughts that have been squirming at the back of my head for a few months, perhaps even a few years, now.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll open this by saying that I&amp;rsquo;m not an artist.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t make art, I don&amp;rsquo;t even critise art, but I enjoy art and one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered time and time again is this: when it comes to art, you &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; fail.&#xA;Now I don&amp;rsquo;t mean this in a &amp;ldquo;if you don&amp;rsquo;t sell well you&amp;rsquo;re going to end up penniless and alone&amp;rdquo; sort-of-way, but moreso that &lt;em&gt;no matter what you make, you will have an audience&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;For better and for worse I guess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to reading comic books, specifically &lt;em&gt;Hellblazer&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened to me this year and the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read certainly reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I start college in little under a month so I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a good idea to go over what I&amp;rsquo;m doing to ease myself back into education.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently decided to start recording some of the songs I make with my acoustic guitar.&#xA;The problem is that with my current setup anything I record sounds like shit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
