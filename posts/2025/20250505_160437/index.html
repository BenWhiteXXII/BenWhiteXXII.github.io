I&rsquo;ve been watching, reading, and listening to a lot of stuff recently so I thought this as good a place as any to jot down some quick thoughts.

<p>This is a style of post that might turn into a series, but with my record don&rsquo;t expect much.
I&rsquo;ve been watching, reading, and listening to a lot of stuff recently so I thought this as good a place as any to jot down some quick thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="things-ive-seen">Things I&rsquo;ve seen</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ninth_Gate">The Ninth Gate</a> - A movie about booksellers and sex cults, staring Johnny Depp and directed by Roman Polanski.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_36th_Chamber_of_Shaolin">The 36th Chamber of Shoalin</a> - The Shaw Brothers&rsquo; classic. A cut above its sequels in all respects but largely in terms of its sincerity.
In doing so this movie has inspired a fervent legacy of imitators and innovators.
A must watch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_the_36th_Chamber">Return to the 36th Chamber</a> - Not as good as the original but worth a watch for the more comedic spin it puts on the structure of the first movie.
You may be able to take down a Shoalin Monk, but the true fighters of this world are the scaffolders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciples_of_the_36th_Chamber">Disciples of the 36th Chamber</a> - Nothing I could say could make this movie worth your time, unless you want to complete the trilogy.
Easy skip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Temple_(1982_film)">Shaolin Temple</a> - If you enjoyed <em>The 36th Chamber</em> definitely give this a watch.
A true martial arts film through and through, Jet Li in his debut role knocks it out of the park.
Not to be confused with the 1976 movie <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Temple_(1982_film)">Shaolin Temple</a></em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC_BCQe_SBs">Sam O&rsquo;Nella Crosswords</a> - Daily uploads of the latest NYT&rsquo;s crossword.
A nice and easy video to have in the background while you do other things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-ive-heard">Things I&rsquo;ve heard</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blackcountrynewroad.bandcamp.com/album/forever-howlong">Forever Howlong</a> - The newest album by BCNR doesn&rsquo;t disappoint.
I&rsquo;ve seen opinions from people on the internet that the band has gone down the shitter as a result of Isaac Wood parting from the band but I prefer the more optimistic, less angst driven sound offered up by Tyler Hyde, Georgia Ellery, and May Kershaw.
They had a lot expected of them after the massive commercial success of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ants_from_Up_There">Ants from up there</a></em> and I believe they exceeded in all regards.
Standouts are &ldquo;Besties&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Big Spin&rdquo;, &ldquo;Salem Sisters&rdquo;, and the titular &ldquo;Forever Howlong&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_World_Knows_Your_Name">When the World Knows Your Name</a> - I&rsquo;m an anomaly in the world of music nerds in that I go to record stores to check out their, usually expansive, collections of cheap CDs.
This was an album that I picked up off the back of their hit <em>Real Gone Kid</em> and I went into it not expecting anything more or less than bright, Scottish pop-rock in the vein of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Juice_(band)">Orange Juice</a></em> and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Camera">Aztec Camera</a></em>.
I recommend it if you&rsquo;re after more of that, though if you are you&rsquo;ve probably already found this album.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Very_Best_of_Cat_Stevens">The Very Best of Cat Stevens</a> - What it says on the tin. This is a CD I picked up with <em>When the World Knows Your Name</em> so that I could exceed the store&rsquo;s Â£5 card minimum but I&rsquo;m glad to have it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-ive-read">Things I&rsquo;ve read</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagoras_(dialogue)">Protagoras</a> - The most common dropping in point for people interested in Plato.
Socrates is an asshole in this one, derailing the argument when it looks like he&rsquo;s losing and constricting his opponents with fallacious statements (that they pick up on) in order to win, so it makes for great reading.
Just don&rsquo;t expect any god-given wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moorcock_bibliography">The Weird of the White Wolf</a> - I&rsquo;m slowly getting through Moorcock&rsquo;s <em>Elric</em> series.
This one leans more into Elric&rsquo;s rapidly molding personality as his moodiness and brooding is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven">dialed up to eleven</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Cognetti">Without Ever Reaching the Summit</a> - Paolo Cognetti&rsquo;s short sprawl over the Tibetan mountains and countryside is lyrical and philosophical, without delving deep into the Country&rsquo;s deep spiritual and geopolitical conflicts.
This one&rsquo;s for nature lovers, by a lover of nature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now.
I might do some more frequent, smaller posts in the future - perhaps weekly or biweekly, or I might decide to go for a big, all month round up like this one was.</p>
