        <p>A lot has happened to me this year and the books I&rsquo;ve read certainly reflect that.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ReadingCohen.jpg" alt="A girl reading Cohen">
From self-help to Stephen King, from journalism to theatre, this eclectic mix represents me trying to find out what I love to read - and looking at the stats I&rsquo;m not suprised.</p>
<p>The majority of the works I read were fiction, and the majority of those were fantasy.
I was suprised to see that only a few of the late Pratchett&rsquo;s books adorned my list, partly because of how much I love his work and how much of his work I bought this year (there&rsquo;s an excellent antique store not far from my house that is always stocked up with his vintage paperbacks).</p>
<p>Smaller pagecounts seem to be a trend, with the odd brick sneeking in (I&rsquo;m looking at you, <em>Babel</em>). This&rsquo;ll be a habit I hope to keep up as I hope to expand my horizons with sci-fi and shorter non-fiction texts in the new year.</p>
<p>Audiobooks were definitely a boon for me at the start of the year, which is why I came out swinging with so many books read and although I don&rsquo;t note which books I listened to (as opposed to read) I may do in the future just so that I can keep track.</p>
<p>As we go down the list I can notice where my infactuation with older texts begins (around may) and is exaggerated by historical fiction and poetry.
In December especially I dove into theatre, reading eveverything I could by the great Athenian tragic playwright Sophecles.
This is something else I hope to keep up with in 2024 as I went a bit overboard in secondhand bookshops, buying up everything ancient Greek + Roman related I could afford.</p>
<p>Into the new year I hope to finish the Monkey Wrench Gang and move onto Howard Fishman&rsquo;s <em>To Anyone Who Ever Asked</em>, a biography about a mysterious singer-songwriter from the 1950s.
After that I plan to re-read <em>Dune</em> ready for the new movie in March.</p>
<h2 id="ps">P.S.</h2>
<p>I should add, for posterity&rsquo;s sake, that I read 39 books.
Not a bad number but I&rsquo;m aiming for at least a book a week in 2024.
Knowing my track record of sticking to goals, let&rsquo;s see how that turns out.</p>
